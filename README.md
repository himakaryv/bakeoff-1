# Bakeoff 1 – Striped Targets + 45° Triangle Cursor (120 FPS)

This folder contains your final Processing sketch.

## Files
- `PointingBakeOff.pde` – main sketch
- `index.html` – simple GitHub Pages site with instructions & download links

## Run locally
1. Install Processing (https://processing.org/download).
2. Open `PointingBakeOff.pde` and press ▶.

## Notes
- System cursor is hidden (`noCursor()`); a red triangle (45°) is drawn at 120 FPS to reduce perceived lag.
- Buttons are red/white concentric targets; active target pulses but all targets remain equally visible (golden rule).
